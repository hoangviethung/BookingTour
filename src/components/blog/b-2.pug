							p Tips for you
							h3 Before traveling
						.table

								tr
									th Transportation
									td If departing from Sa Pa Town or Y Ty Commune, you can either rent a motorbike or hop on a coach to reach the Muong Hum intersection. The road is wide enough for a six-seater car. However, a rental motorbike is recommended since the path is beautiful and you might want to stop along the way for some pictures.
								tr
									th When to go
									td The most optimal period for your Bach Moc Luong Tu conquest is from August to May. The rainy season lasts from June to July during which the trails are slippery and dangerous. July is to be especially avoided since the winds are extremely strong and violent.
								tr
									th Guide/porter
									td There are two reasons why you need to hire a porter for your hike. Firstly, the trails can get deadly dangerous. Secondly, some have reportedly climbed the mountain alone only to mysteriously disappear without ever being found. Also, porters are skilled experts and can prevent disorientation during the route. A Tru is our recommendation since he was very friendly and enthusiastic during our trip. His contact number is 0914 402 295.
								tr
									th Accommodation
									td At an altitude of 2,100 m, there are many H’mong huts where one can spend the night. These huts are fully equipped with bedding and sleeping bags. An additional cost of VND50,000 ($2) is charged for a shower and a medicinal foot soak costs VND20,000 ($0.9).
								tr
									th Food
									td All of our meals were made with local ingredients from the village including livestock like chicken and pork, forest vegetables, corn wine, and rice wine. For breakfast we had rice porridge, fried rice, and rice balls with sesame salt.
								tr
									th Duration
									td For those who are less active with less stamina, a three-day and two-night trip is recommended. More active and stronger hikers can opt for a two-day and one-night trip.
								tr
									th Cost
									td The cost is VND1.4 million ($60) for the trip if you depart from Sa Pa. If you choose to be picked up by a porter from Muong Hum, the cost is less at VND900,000 ($39).
								tr
									th Hiking gear
									td  You will need trekking poles, hiking shoes, hiking gloves, a wide-brim hat, flashlight, and medicine.
